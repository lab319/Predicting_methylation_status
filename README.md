# deep-learning-based framework
Predicting DNA methylation status by integrating a deep neural network with random forest

# Prerequisites
- Python (2.7.12)
- Numpy (1.11.1)
- Keras (1.2.0)
- Theano (1.0.4)

# Data
- "data" is finally used to train the framework proposed in this paper
- " DNA methylation status" represents label data
- " DNA methylation feature " represents feature data

# Usage
To implement the model, run file model.pkl, which is a DNN model that has been trained.
# Other machine learning models
We compared the prediction performance of our random forest classifier with several other classifiers based on abstract features and standardized features
